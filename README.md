This is my final project for Code Louisville. The features from the project list I used are listed below. The JavaScript math function is at the bottom of the page. The user will enter 1 number in each box and when they click the score button it will sum the totals. 


CSS Features List
    A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

    Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.

JavaScript Features List
    Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value to do something on the site.
