# AussieRules

This is my final project for Code Louisville. It uses CSS features to switch the style of the navigation menu as well as Flexbox to rearrange content for mobile or desktop views. I created a JavaScript function that calculates an example score from an Australian Rules Football game. A user will input a number into each box then click the score button. The user will see the generated score below the button. 
CSS Features List
A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.
JavaScript Features List
Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value to do something on the site.
